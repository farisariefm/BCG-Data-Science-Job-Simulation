# Customer Churn Prediction Analysis for PowerCo

## Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of historical customer data, pricing information, and churn indicators to uncover patterns and variables significantly contributing to customer churn at PowerCo. The project aims to build a predictive model that forecasts the likelihood of churn based on factors like price sensitivity and historical usage patterns.

## Project Background

PowerCo, a leading gas and electricity utility provider, is experiencing increased customer churn in the SME segment. In light of market liberalization in Europe, competition has intensified, leading to an uptick in client turnover. PowerCo, in partnership with BCG, is seeking to analyze and mitigate the causes of this churn.

## Problem Statement

This project centers on identifying the drivers behind PowerCo's customer churn, with a focus on understanding why customers are switching to competitors, especially within the SME segment.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

1. **Churn Distribution:** Churning customers represent approximately 9.7% of the customer base.
2. **Significant Correlations:** Identified key features correlated with churn.
3. **Price Sensitivity Impact:** Price sensitivity is not the primary driver of churn.
4. **Data Distribution:** Skewed distributions indicate potential outliers.
5. **Further Investigation:** Additional factors are identified for deeper analysis.

## Model Insights

The model demonstrates exceptional performance with near-perfect prediction accuracy. While it currently requires no adjustments, metrics like recall and F-1 Score are recommended for future tuning to further improve its predictive capabilities.

## Executive Summary

- **Churn Rate:** 9.7% of 14,606 customers have churned.
- **Key Features:** Consumption and net margin over the past 12 months are strongly correlated with churn.
- **Future Work:** Investigation into customer satisfaction, service quality, and market factors is suggested to enhance understanding of churn.
